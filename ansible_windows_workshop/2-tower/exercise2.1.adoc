= Exercise 2.1 - Configuring Ansible Tower




In this exercise, we are going to configure Tower so that we can run a playbook.



== Configuring Ansible Tower

There are a number of contructs in the Ansible Tower UI that enable multi-tenancy, notifications, scheduling, etc.
However, we are only going to focus on a few of the key contructs that are required for this workshop today.


* Credentials
* Projects
* Inventory
* Job Template




== Logging into Tower and Installing the License Key


=== Step 1:

To log in, use the username *admin* and the password *ansibleWS*.  Note that typically AD/LDAP authentication would be setup.  However, that is beyond the scope of this workshop.

As soon as you login, you will prompted to request a license or browse for an existing license file

image::2.0-tower-license-prompt.png[title="Uploading a License",width=1000]



=== Step 2:

In a seperate browser tab, download your license key. Your license key should be provided by your instructor.

Back in the Tower UI, choose *BROWSE* image:at_browse.png[LicB,35,25] and upload your recently downloaded license file into Tower. Select *_I agree to the End User License Agreement_* and click *SUBMIT* image:at_submit.png[Sub,35,25].


== Creating a Machine Credential

Credentials are utilized by Tower for authentication when launching jobs against machines,
synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

There are many link:{cred_url}[types of credentials] including machine, network, and various cloud providers.  In this
workshop, we are using a *machine* credential.


=== Step 1:

Select the gear icon     image:at_gear.png[Gear,20,20]

=== Step 2:

Select *CREDENTIALS*

=== Step 3:

Click on *ADD*     image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 4:

Complete the form using the following entries: 

|===
|NAME |Ansible Workshop Credential
|DESCRIPTION|Machine credential for run job templates during workshop
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|TYPE|Machine
|USERNAME| student#
|PASSWORD| <your AD account password - instructor provided>
|===

[NOTE]
Notice here we've made a change from our previous examples.  Previously we were using basic authentication with a local `Adminstrator` account.  Now we are switching to an AD user and Kerberos authentication.  We will also update our inventory variables to reflect Kerberos.

=== Step 5:

Select SAVE     image:at_save.png[Save,35,25] +

== Create an SCM Credential

Our first credential was to access our Windows machines.  We need another to access our source code repository.  Repeat the process as above, but with the following details:
|===
|NAME |Git Credential
|DESCRIPTION|SCM credential for playbook sync
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|TYPE|Source Control
|USERNAME| student#
|PASSWORD| <your AD account password - instructor provided>
|===

Make sure you select *SAVE*!

== Creating a Project

A Project is a logical collection of Ansible playbooks, represented in Tower.
You can manage playbooks and playbook directories by either placing them manually
under the Project Base Path on your Tower server, or by placing your playbooks into
a source code management (SCM) system supported by Tower, including Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

=== Step 1:

Click *PROJECTS* at the upper left

=== Step 2:

Select *ADD*     image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 3:

Complete the form using the following entries (using your student number)

|===
|NAME |Ansible Workshop Project
|DESCRIPTION|workshop playbooks
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|SCM TYPE|Git
|SCM URL|https://gitlab.rhdemo.io/student#/student#-playbooks.git
|SCM BRANCH|<leave empty>
|SCM CREDENTIAL|Git Credential
|SCM UPDATE OPTIONS
a|

- [*] Clean
- [*] Delete on Update
- [*] Update on Launch

=== Step 4:

Select SAVE     image:at_save.png[Save,35,25]




== Creating a Inventory

An inventory is a collection of hosts against which jobs may be launched.
Inventories are divided into groups and these groups contain the actual hosts.
Groups may be sourced manually, by entering host names into Tower, or from one
of Ansible Towerâ€™s supported cloud providers.

An Inventory can also be imported into Tower using the *tower-manage* command
and this is how we are going to add an inventory for this workshop.


=== Step 1:

Click *INVENTORIES*

=== Step 2:

Select *ADD* and select Inventory    image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 3:

Complete the form using the following entries

|===
|NAME |Ansible Workshop Inventory
|DESCRIPTION|workshop hosts
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|===



image::2.1-tower-create-inventory.png[title="Create an Inventory",width=1000]



=== Step 4:

Select SAVE     image:at_save.png[Save,35,25]

=== Step 5:

Using putty, login into your tower node if you closed the window previously


[source,bash]
----
student#-control.rhdemo.io
----




=== Step 6:

Use the `tower-manage` command to import an existing inventory.  (_Be sure to replace <username> with your actual username_)
----
sudo tower-manage inventory_import --source=/home/student#/lightbulb/lessons/lab_inventory/student#-instances.txt --inventory-name="Ansible Workshop Inventory"
----

You should see output similar to the following:



image::at_tm_stdout.png[title="Importing an inventory with tower-manage"]




Feel free to browse your inventory in Tower.  You should now notice that the inventory has been populated with Groups and that
each of those groups contain hosts.

=== End Result

At this point, we are doing with our basic configuration of Ansible Tower.  In exercise 2.2, we will be solely focused on creating and running a job template so you can see Tower in action.
