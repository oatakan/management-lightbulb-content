= Exercise 2.0 - Installing Ansible Tower



In this exercise, we are going to get Ansible Tower installed on your control node

== Installing Ansible Tower


=== Step 1:

Use putty to SSH to your Tower node.  Change directories to /tmp

[source,bash]
----
cd /tmp
----

=== Step 2:

Download the latest Ansible Tower package

[source,bash]
----
curl -O http://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz
----

=== Step 3:

Untar and unzip the package file

[source,bash]
----
tar xvfz /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz
----

=== Step 4:

Change directories into the ansible tower package

[source,bash]
----
cd /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-*
----

=== Step 5:

Using an editor of your choice, open the inventory file

[source,bash]
----
vi inventory
----

=== Step 6:

Fill a few variables out in an inventory file: `admin_password, pg_password, rabbitmq_password`

A few hints for `vi` if it's not your thing.

* Move around the file with your arrow keys
* `a` enters into `add` mode
* `esc` exits add mode
* `x` when not in add mode will `delete` a character
* `esc` followed by `:wq!` will save the file
** Just doing `:q!` will exit without saving

[tower]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[database]

[all:vars]
admin_password=*'ansibleWS'*

pg_host=''
pg_port=''

pg_database='awx'
pg_username='awx'
pg_password=*'ansibleWS'*

rabbitmq_port=5672
rabbitmq_vhost=tower
rabbitmq_username=tower
rabbitmq_password=*'ansibleWS'*
rabbitmq_cookie=cookiemonster

# Needs to be true for fqdns and ip addresses
rabbitmq_use_long_name=false

----

=== Step 7:

Run the Ansible Tower setup script

[source,bash]
----
sudo ./setup.sh
----

[NOTE]
Step 7 will take approx. 10-15 minutes to complete.  This uses ansible to install Tower.  This may be a good time to take a break.

=== Step 8:

As our git has a self signed cert, we have one more configuration step.  We need to enable tower to not verify SSL for repo syncs.  To do this, execute the following commands:

----
sudo su -
echo "AWX_TASK_ENV['GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY'] = 'True'" >> /etc/tower/settings.py
ansible-tower-service restart
exit
----



=== End Result

At this point, your Ansible Tower installation should be complete.
You can access Tower from the browser on your student#-wks host at:


[source,bash]
----
https://student#-control.rhdemo.io
----

[NOTE]
As we're using a self-signed cert you will have to ignore the security warning and `Add` this site as trusted.

=== Ensuring Installation Success

You know you were successful if you are able to browse to your Ansible Tower's url and get something like this
