= Exercise 3.0 - Windows Patching with Ansible

Patching windows systems can be a very time consuming task, but working with ansible you could reduce this time significantly.

In this exercise, you will update your windows nodes.

== Creating a new Playbook

=== Step 1:

Within Visual Studio Code, create a new directory in your git repo and create a site.yml file.

In the Explorer accordion you should have a 'student#-playbooks' section.

Create a folder called *windows_patching* and a file called *patch_windows.yml*.

Hover over the *student#-playbooks* section and click the *New Folder* button.

Type *windows_patching* and press enter.  Then click that folder so it is selected.

Hover over the *student#-playbooks* section again and click the *New File* button.

Type *patch_windows.yml* and press enter.

You should now have an editor open in the right pane that can be used for creating your playbook.


=== Step 2:

Add a play to your playbook.  These include defining serial parameter which executes the playbook in stages to it doesn't try patch all systems all at once.

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: windows
  serial:
   - 25%
  max_fail_percentage: 25%
  vars:
    win_updates_categories:
      - CriticalUpdates
      - SecurityUpdates
  tasks:
  - name: Check for missing updates
    win_updates:
      state: searched
      category_names: "{{ win_updates_categories }}"
    register: search_updates

  - name: Show missing updates
    debug:
      var: search_updates

  - name: Install missing updates.
    win_updates:
      category_names: "{{ win_updates_categories }}"
    register: apply_updates

  - name: Reboot if needed
    win_reboot:
      reboot_timeout: 3600
    when: apply_updates.reboot_required
----

=== Step 3: Commit and Review

Your new, improved playbook is done! But remember we still need to commit the changes to source code control.

Click *File -> Save All* to save the files you've written

Click on the Source Code icon, type in a commit message such as *Adding a new playbook*, and click the check box above.


Sync to gitlab by clicking the arrows on the lower left blue bar.  When prompted, click *OK* to push and pull commits.

It should take 20-30 seconds to finish the commit.  The blue bar should stop rotating and indicate 0 problems...

== Running your playbook from Tower

=== Step 1:

In order for Tower to pick up the latest playbook addition into source control repository, you need to resync the project. Navigate to *PROJECTS* and click the resync icon next to

image::3.1-tower-resync_project.png[title="Resync Project"]

Wait for the green circle to finish bouncing next to project name. You can also check the *LAST UPDATED* column to verify.

=== Step 2:

Create a new job template in tower and add patch_windows playbook.

=== Step 3:

Run the playbook from Tower and review the results.

In the execution output on the right, review the *Show missing updates* task:

[NOTE]
Installation of the updates may take a while. You can come back and review the results later.

=== Step 4:

Note that it ran through one node at a time before starting on the other one. Is this what you expected?

Review the playbook:

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: windows
  serial:
   - 25%
  max_fail_percentage: 25%
----

Note that playbook is set to run in serial mode with 25% of the nodes in the inventory.


=== Step 5:

Re-run the job template and review the results. Notice it took a very short time to validate the end-state.


=== End Result

After running the playbook from Tower, it will update your nodes with the latest patches.
