= Exercise 3.1 - Using Ansible for Desired State Config

By using Desired State Config, you can further simplify your playbooks.

For a full understanding of Desired State Config with Ansible: +
link:{ansible_win_dsc_url}[Ansible win_dsc documentation] +
link:{win_dsc_module_url}[win_dsc Module] +
You can see list of DSC resources and examples that can be used in conjunction with Ansible win_dsc module: +
link:{dsc_resource}[DSC Resources]

In this exercise you will install IIS using win_dsc modules.

== Creating a new Playbook

=== Step 1:

Within Visual Studio Code, create a new directory in your git repo and create a site.yml file.

In the Explorer accordion you should have a 'student#-playbooks' section.

Create a folder called *iis_dsc* and a file called *install_iis_with_dsc.yml*.

Hover over the *student#-playbooks* section and click the *New Folder* button.

Type *iis_dsc* and press enter.  Then click that folder so it is selected.

Hover over the *student#-playbooks* section again and click the *New File* button.

Type *install_iis_with_dsc.yml* and press enter.

You should now have an editor open in the right pane that can be used for creating your playbook.

=== Step 2:

Add a play to your playbook. You will re-write iis installation playbook using dsc modules:
[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: windows
  name: This is a play within a playbook
  vars:
    iis_sites:
      - name: Ansible Playbook Test 3
        port: 8082
        path: C:\sites\playbooktest3
      - name: Ansible Playbook Test 4
        port: 8083
        path: C:\sites\playbooktest4
    iis_test_message: "Hello World!  My test IIS Server"

  tasks:
    - name: Install required DSC modules
      win_psmodule:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items:
        - xWebAdministration
        - xNetworking

    - name: Install IIS
      win_dsc:
        resource_name: windowsfeature
        name: Web-Server

    - name: Create site directory structure
      win_dsc:
        resource_name: file
        ensure: Present
        type: Directory
        destinationpath: "{{ item.path }}"
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

    - name: Create IIS site
      win_dsc:
        resource_name: xWebsite
        ensure: Present
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        bindinginfo:
          port: "{{ item.port }}"
        state: started
        physicalpath: "{{ item.path }}"
        dependson: "[WindowsFeature]IIS"
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"
      notify: restart iis service

    - name: Open port for site on the firewall
      win_dsc:
        resource_name: xFirewall
        ensure: Present
        name: "iisport{{ item.port }}"
        enabled: True
        localport: "{{ item.port }}"
        action: Allow
        direction: Inbound
        protocol: TCP
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"
      notify: restart iis service

    - name: Template simple web site to iis_site_path as index.html
      win_template:
        src: 'index.html.j2'
        dest: '{{ item.path }}\index.html'
      with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

  handlers:
    - name: restart iis service
      win_dsc:
        resource_name: service
        name: W3Svc
        state: restarted
        startuptype: auto

Review the following DSC modules pages:

link:{dsc_xwebadministration}[xWebAdministration PowerShell DSC Module] +
link:{dsc_xnetworking}[xNetworking PowerShell DSC Module]

*xWebAdministration* module contains *xWebsite* resource +
*xNetworking* module contains *xFirewall* resource


=== Step 3: Commit and Review

Your new, improved playbook is done! But remember we still need to commit the changes to source code control.

Click *File -> Save All* to save the files you've written

Click on the Source Code icon, type in a commit message such as *Adding a new playbook*, and click the check box above.


Sync to gitlab by clicking the arrows on the lower left blue bar.  When prompted, click *OK* to push and pull commits.

It should take 20-30 seconds to finish the commit.  The blue bar should stop rotating and indicate 0 problems...

== Running your playbook from Tower

=== Step 1:

In order for Tower to pick up the latest playbook addition into source control repository, you need to resync the project. Navigate to *PROJECTS* and click the resync icon next to

image::3.1-tower-resync_project.png[title="Resync Project"]

Wait for the green circle to finish bouncing next to project name. You can also check the *LAST UPDATED* column to verify.

=== Step 2:

Create a new job template in tower and add install_iis_with_dsc playbook.

image::3.2-tower-add_install_iis_with_dsc_template.png[title="Add Apply Windows Patches template"]

=== Step 3:

Run the playbook from Tower and review the results.

In the execution output on the right, review the *Show missing updates* task:

image::3.1-tower-windows_patching_missing_updates_task.png[title="Show missing updates task"]

[NOTE]
Installation of the updates may take a while. You can come back and review the results later.

=== Step 4:

Note that it ran through one node at a time before starting on the other one. Is this what you expected?

Review the playbook:

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: windows
  serial:
   - 25%
  max_fail_percentage: 25%
----

Note that playbook is set to run in serial mode with 25% of the nodes in the inventory.


=== Step 5:

Re-run the job template and review the results. Notice it took a very short time to validate the end-state.
