= Exercise 1.1 - Writing Your First playbook


Now that you've gotten a sense of how ansible works, we are going to write our first
ansible *playbook*.  The playbook is where you can take some of those ad-hoc commands you just ran
and put them into a repeatable set of *plays* and *tasks*.

A playbook can have multiple plays and a play
can have one or multiple tasks.  The goal of a *play* is to map a group of hosts.  The goal of a *task* is to implement modules against those hosts.

For our first playbook, we are only going to write one play and two tasks.

== Overview

Starting at this task we are going to work from our workstation host.  We will use Visual Studio Code as our editor.  In addition, we will use GitLab for source code control.  This will allow us to minimize development work on the linux command line.  Other editors or source code solutions can be used, but this will show the general workflow.

Alternatively you can login to gitlab and use built-in text editor to commit directly. This can be useful when you have slow connection to workstation instance. Check with your instructor if you have any questions.

== Section 1: Creating a Directory Structure and Files for your Playbook

There is a link:{dir_url}[best practice] on the preferred directory structures for playbooks.  We strongly encourage
you to read and understand these practices as you develop your Ansible ninja skills.  That said,
our playbook today is very basic and creating a complex structure will just confuse things.

Instead, we are going to create a very simple directory structure for our playbook, and add just a couple of files to it.


*Step 1:* Open Visual Studio Code and Clone an empty git repository

When you open Visual Studio Code, a 'Welcome' screen will load.  When prompted, choose `Firefox` as your default browser (and don't import anything).  You can close the browser for now.

[NOTE]
Internet Explorer 11 has some issues with Ansible Tower in the later labs.  Due to this we will use Firefox in these examples.

In the main window, press Ctrl + Shift + P to bring up the action search window. Type Git: Clone and select.

At the top, enter *https://gitlab.rhdemo.io/student#/student#-playbooks*, *where # is your student number*.

image::1.1-vscode-gitclone-url.png[title="Git Clone URL",width=1000]

When it prompts you for directory, leave the default (C:\Users\student#)

You will see the progress spin in the bottom left bar.  Eventually you will be prompted for your gitlab user/password.  (Watch your menu bar for this to pop up)  Use your AD credentials (student#/...)

image::1.1-vscode-gitclonepassword.png[title="Git Clone Password",width=1000]


Once synced, click the *Open Repository* button at the top.

At this point in the Explorer accordion you should have a 'student#-playbooks' section with no files.

image::1-1-vscode-studentplaybooks.png[title="Student Playbooks Repo",width=1000]

*Step 2:* Create a directory and called *iis_basic* and a file called `install_iis.yml`

Hover over the **student#-playbooks **section and click on the *New Folder* button

Type *iis_basic* and press enter.  Then click on that folder so it is selected.

Hover over the *student#-playbooks* section again and click on the *New File* button.

Type *install_iis.yml* and press enter.

You should now have an editor open in the right pane that can be used for creating your playbook.

== Section 2: Defining Your Play

Now that you are editing `install_iis.yml`, let's begin by defining the play and then understanding what each line accomplishes

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: windows
  name: Install the IIS web service
----



- `---` Defines the beginning of YAML
- `hosts: windows` Defines the host group in your inventory on which this play will run against
- `name: Install the IIS web service` This describes our play


== Section 3: Adding Tasks to Your Play

Now that we've defined your play, let's add some tasks to get some things done.  Align (vertically) the *t* in `task` with the *n* `name`.  +
Yes, it does actually matter.  In fact, you should make sure all of your playbook statements are aligned in the way shown here. +
If you want to see the entire playbook for reference, skip to the bottom of this exercise.


[source,bash]
----
  tasks:
   - name: Install IIS
     win_feature:
       name: Web-Server
       state: present

   - name: Start IIS Service
     win_service:
       name: W3Svc
       state: started
----


- `tasks:` This denotes that one or more tasks are about to be defined
- `- name:` Each task requires a name which will print to standard output when you run your playbook.
Therefore, give your tasks a name that is short, sweet, and to the point


[source,bash]
----
win_feature:
  name: Web-Server
  state: present
----


- These three lines are calling the Ansible module *win_feature* to install the IIS Web Server.
link:{win_feature_url}[Click here] to see all options for the win_feature module.



[source,bash]
----
win_service:
  name: W3Svc
  state: started
----


- The next few lines are using the ansible module *win_service* to start the IIS service.  The win_service module
is the preferred way of controlling services on remote hosts.  link:{win_service_url}[Click here] to learn more
about the *win_service* module.



== Section 4: Saving your Playbook

Now that you've completed writing your playbook, it would be a shame not to keep it.

Click 'File' from the menu and then click 'Save'


And that should do it.  You should now have a fully written playbook called `install_iis.yml`.

*_But wait!!!_*  We haven't committed our changes from our local copy to source code.
Click on the Source Code icon as shown below (It is the middle on the far left of the page that has the blue circle with # 1 in it)

Type in a commit message such as *Adding install_iis.yml* and click the check box above to commit.

image::1.1-vscode-install_iis.yml_commit.png[title="Git Commit install_iis.yml",width=1000]

This will prompt to ask if you want to stage the changes.  Click on 'Always' and you won't be prompted again.

image::1.1-vscode-stage_commits_always.png[title="Stage Commits Always",width=600]

Now you need to push the committed changes to your repository.

On the bottom left blue bar, click the cloud with the up arrow on it to publish changes.

Next in the top of the window it will prompt you to pick a remote to publish to.  Choose the default (`origin`)

image::1.1-vscode-gitpush_origin.png[title="Git Push Origin",width=1000]

This may take as long as 30 seconds to push.  If you're interested in validating the code is in git, you can connect to gitlab to verify.  Open `Firefox` and connect to `https://gitlab.rhdemo.io`.  Login with your AD user (student#) and password and you should see your repo.

You are ready to automate!


[NOTE]
Ansible (well, YAML really) can be a bit particular about formatting especially around indentation/spacing.  When you all get back to the office,
read up on this link:{yaml_url}[YAML Syntax] a bit more and it will save you some headaches later.  In the meantime, your completed playbook should look
like this.  Take note of the spacing and alignment.

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: windows
  name: Install the IIS web service

  tasks:
    - name: Install IIS
      win_feature:
        name: Web-Server
        state: present

    - name: Start IIS Service
      win_service:
        name: W3Svc
        state: started
----
