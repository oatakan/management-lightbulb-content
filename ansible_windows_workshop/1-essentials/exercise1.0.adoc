= Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad-hoc commands


== Section 1: Ad-hoc commands

For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get
a feel for how Ansible works.  Ansible Ad-Hoc commands enable you to perform tasks
on remote nodes without having to write a playbook.  They are very useful when you
simply need to do one or two things quickly and often, to many remote nodes.


=== Step 0:

SSH into your *control* host and define your inventory.  Inventories are crucial to Ansible as they define remote machines on which you wish to run
commands or your playbook(s).  For this workshop we have already created a base inventory file to save you the effort.  Use `cat ~/lightbulb/lessons/lab_inventory/student#-instances.txt` to view the file.  Notice there is a section of vars to be assigned to particular groups.  Then there are individual hosts within groups including authentication details.

====
[NOTE]
At this point we are just using basic authentication to a local Administrator.  Also, the password is clear text in the inventory.  Later in this workshop we will show how to use AD authentication and securely store credentials.

=== Step 1:

Let's start with something really basic - pinging a host.  The *win_ping* module makes sure our windows hosts are responsive.  This is not a traditional 'ping', but actually verifying connectivity to the host.

Ansible uses WinRM to interact with Windows hosts.  This has already been setup in our lab.  However, in other environments a script to enable this is provided here: (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1)

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_ping
----

=== Step 2:

Now let's see how we can run a PowerShell command and view the output using the `win_shell` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_shell -a "Get-Service"
ansible windows -m win_shell -a "Get-Process"
----

=== Step 3:

Take a look at your windows nodes configuration.  The `setup` module displays ansible facts (and a lot of them) about an endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m setup
----

=== Step 4:

Now, let's install IIS using the `win_feature` module. It may take a moment to complete.

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_feature -a "name=Web-Server state=present"
----

=== Step 5:

OK, IIS is installed now so let's be certain it is started using the `service` module.  Test connectivity with curl to see a base IIS page (Make certain to replace # with your user number).

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_service -a "name=W3Svc state=started"
curl http://student#-node1/
----

=== Step 6:

Finally, let's clean up after ourselves.  First, stop the httpd service.  You can verify again the the curl just hangs.  (ctrl-c to break out of the command)

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_service -a "name=W3Svc state=stopped"
curl http://student#-node1/
----

=== Step 7:

Next, remove the IIS feature and reboot.

[source,bash]
----
ansible windows -m win_feature -a "name=Web-Server state=absent"
ansible windows -m win_reboot
----
You can run *win_ping* module as you did earlier to verify the systems are back online.

====
[NOTE]
Like many Linux commands, `ansible` allows for long-form options as well as short-form.  For example:

----
ansible windows --module-name win_ping
----
is the same as running
----
ansible windows -m win_ping
----
We are going to be using the short-form options throughout this workshop
