= Exercise 1.2 - Running Your Playbook


== Section 1: Running the Playbook


We are now going to run you're brand spankin' new playbook on your two windows nodes.  To do this,
 you are going to use the `ansible-playbook` command.

=== Step 1:

Use putty to login to your student#-control host as student#

Clone the playbooks from source code and then execute the playbook.  Be certain to use your student number below.  Also, due to our self-signed cert we need to first disable ssl verification

[source,bash]
----
git config --global http.sslVerify false

# Setup to cache git credentials in memory for a day
git config --global credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=86400'

git clone https://gitlab.rhdemo.io/student#/student#-playbooks.git
	# Username is student# and your associated password.
cd student#-playbooks/iis_basic
ansible-playbook install_iis.yml
----

[NOTE]
If you have already cloned the repository, you can run a 'git pull' within the directory to get the latest version.

However, before you go ahead and run that command, lets take a few moments to understand some options.

- *-i* This option could be used to specify the inventory file you wish to use.  We are using the default (/etc/ansible/hosts)
- *-v* Altough not used here, this increases verbosity.  Try running your playbook a second time using `-v` or `-vv` to increase the verbosity


[NOTE]
- *--syntax-check* If you run into any issues with your playbook running properly; you know, from that copy/pasting that you didn't do because we said "_don't do that_"; you could use this option to help find those issues like so...

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook install_iis.yml --syntax-check
----


---
OK, go ahead and run your playbook as specified in *Step 1*

In standard output, you should see something that looks very similar to the following:

image::1.2-putty-playbook_install_iis.png[title="install_iis playbook stdout",width=1000]


Notice that the play and each task is named so that you can see what is being done and to which node it is being done to.
You also may notice a task in there that you didn't write;  <cough> `setup` <cough>.  This is because the `setup` module
runs by default.  To turn if off, you can specify link:{gather_facts-url}[gather_facts: false] in your play definition like this:


[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: windows
  name: Install the IIS web server
  gather_facts: false
----



=== Step 2:

Remove IIS

OK, for the next several minutes or as much time as we can afford, we want to to experiment a little.
We would like you to reverse what you've done, i.e. stop and uninstall iis on your web nodes.
So, go ahead and make a copy of your playbook in Visual Studio Code named 'remove_iis.yml', edit and commit the changes, and run as previous.
For this exercise we aren't going to show you line by line, but we will give you a few hints.

[NOTE]

- If your first task in the playbook was to install Web-Server feature  and the second task was to start the service, which order do you think
those tasks should be in now?
- If `started` makes sure a service is started, then what option ensures it is stopped?
- If `present` makes sure a feature is installed, then what option ensures it is removed?  Er... starts with an *ab*, ends with a *sent*
