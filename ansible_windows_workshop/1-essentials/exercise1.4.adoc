= Exercise 1.4 - Running the apache-basic-playbook

Congratulations!  You just wrote a playbook that incorporates some key Ansible concepts that you use in
most if not all of your future playbooks.  Before you get too excited though, we should probably make sure
it actually runs.

So, lets do that now.

== Section 1 - Running your new iis playbook

=== Step 1:
Use putty to login to your student#-control host as student#

Pull the latest playbooks from source code and then execute the playbook.  Be certain to use your student number below.

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/student#-playbooks
git pull
# Or if you don't have the directory:
# git clone https://gitlab.rhdemo.io/student#/student#-playbooks.git
cd iis_basic_playbook
----

[NOTE]
Since you already have an inventory file, ~/lightbulb/lessons/lab_inventory/student#-instances.txt, we will re-use it.

=== Step 2:
Run your playbook

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook site.yml
----

== Section 2: Review

If successful, you should see standard output that looks very similar to the following.  If not, just let us
know.  We'll help get things fixed up.

Your output may vary from above based on whether you removed IIS previously or not.

Once completed, on your workstation you can open firefox and test a connection to one of your servers (student#-node1 or student#-node2):

* http://student#-node1.rhdemo.io:8080/
* http://student#-node2.rhdemo.io:8081/

[NOTE]
DNS is only available in your workstation environment, so you will not be able to connect remotely from your own machine
