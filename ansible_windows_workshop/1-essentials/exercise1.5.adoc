= Exercise 1.5 - Roles: Making your playbooks reusable


While it is possible to write a playbook in one file as we've done throughout this workshop, eventually youâ€™ll want to reuse files and start to organize things.

Ansible Roles is the way we do this.  When you create a role, you deconstruct your playbook into parts and those parts sit in a directory structure.  "Wha??  You mean that seemingly useless link:{dir_url}[best practice] you mentioned in exercise 1.1?".  Yep, that one.

For this exercise, you are going to take the playbook you just wrote and refactor it into a role.

Let's begin with seeing how your iis-basic-playbook will break down into a role...

== Section 1: Create directory structure for your new role

=== Step 1:

In Visual Studio Code, navigate to explorer and your `student#-playbooks` project where you previously made iis_basic_playbook.

image::1.5-vscode-beginning.png[title="iis_basic_playbook",width=1000]

Select the *iis_basic_playbook* folder.

Create a directory called *roles*  by right-clicking *iis_basic_playbook* and selecting *New Folder*.

Now right-click on *roles* and create a new folder called *iis_simple*.

=== Step 2:

Within *iis_simple* create new folders as follows:

  * defaults
  * vars
  * handlers
  * tasks
  * templates

=== Step 3:

Within each of these new folders, right-click and create *New File*.
Create a file called *main.yml* in each of these folders. Do not do this under templates as we will create individual template files.  This is your basic role structure and main.yml will be the default file that the role will use for each section.

The finished structure will look like this:

image::1.5-vscode-role_structure.png[title="Role Structure",width=1000]

== Section 2: Breaking Your `site.yml` Playbook into the Newly Created `iis_simple` Role

In this section, we will separate out the major parts of your playbook including `vars:`, `tasks:`, `template:`, and `handlers:`.

=== Step 1:

Make a backup copy of *site.yml*, then create a new *site.yml*.

Navigate to your *iis_basic_playbook* folder, right click *site.yml*, click *rename*, and name it as *site.yml.backup*.

Create a blank new file called *site.yml* in the same folder.

=== Step 2:

Update *site.yml* to look like to only call your role.  It should look like below:

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: windows
  name: This is my role-based playbook

  roles:
    - iis_simple
----

image::1.5-vscode-new_site.yml.png[title="New site.yml",width=1000]

=== Step 3:

Add a default variable to your role.  Edit the *roles\iis_simple\defaults\main.yml* as follows:

[source,bash]
----
---
# defaults file for iis_simple
iis_sites:
  - name: 'Ansible Playbook Test'
    port: '8080'
    path: 'C:\sites\playbooktest'
  - name: 'Ansible Playbook Test 2'
    port: '8081'
    path: 'C:\sites\playbooktest2'
----

=== Step 4:

Add some role-specific variables to your role in *roles\iis_simple\vars\main.yml*.

[source,bash]
----
---
# vars file for iis_simple
iis_test_message: "Hello World!  My test IIS Server"
----

[NOTE]
====
*Hey, wait just a minute there buster... did you just have us put variables in two seperate places?* +

Yes... yes we did.  Variables can live in quite a few places.  Just to name a few: +

- vars directory
- defaults directory
- group_vars directory
- In the playbook under the `vars:` section
- In any file which can be specified on the command line using the `--extra_vars` option
- On a boat, in a moat, with a goat  _(disclaimer:  this is a complete lie)_

Bottom line, you need to read up on link:{var_prec_url}[variable precedence] to understand both where to define variables and which locations take precedence.  In this exercise, we are using role defaults to define a couple of variables and these are the most malleable.  After that, we defined some variables in `/vars`
which have a higher precedence than defaults and can't be overridden as a default variable.
====

=== Step 5:

Create your role handler in *roles\iis_simple\handlers\main.yml*.

[source,bash]
----
---
# handlers file for iis_simple
- name: restart iis service
  win_service:
    name: W3Svc
    state: restarted
    start_mode: auto
----

=== Step 6:

Add tasks to your role in *roles\iis_simple\tasks\main.yml*.

[source,bash]
----
---
# tasks file for iis_simple

- name: Install IIS
  win_feature:
    name: Web-Server
    state: present

- name: Create site directory structure
  win_file:
    path: "{{ item.path }}"
    state: directory
  with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

- name: Create IIS site
  win_iis_website:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    state: started
    port: "{{ item.port }}"
    physical_path: "{{ item.path }}"
  with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"
  notify: restart iis service

- name: Open port for site on the firewall
  win_firewall_rule:
    name: "iisport{{ item.port }}"
    enable: yes
    state: present
    localport: "{{ item.port }}"
    action: Allow
    direction: In
    protocol: Tcp
    force: true
  with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"

- name: Template simple web site to iis_site_path as index.html
  win_template:
    src: 'index.html.j2'
    dest: '{{ item.path }}\index.html'
  with_items: "{{ iis_sites }}"
----

=== Step 7:

Add your *index.html* template.

Right-click *roles\iis_simple\templates* and create a new file called *index.html.j2* with the following content:

[source,bash]
----
<html>
<body>

  <p align=center><img src='http://docs.ansible.com/images/logo.png' align=>
  <h1 align=center>{{ ansible_hostname }} --- {{ iis_test_message }}

</body>
</html>
----

=== Step 8: Commit
Click  *File -> Save All* to ensure all your files are saved.

Click the Source Code icon as shown below.

Type in a commit message like `Add iis_simple role` and click the check box above.

image::1.5-vscode-commit_iis_simple_role.png[title="Commit iis_simple_role",width=1000]


Click the *synchronize changes* button on the blue bar at the bottom left (and click *OK*).  This should again return with no problems.


== Section 3: Running your new role-based playbook

Now that you've successfully separated your original playbook into a role,
let's run it and see how it works.

=== Step 1:

Run the playbook on your tower host.

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/student#-playbooks
git pull
cd iis_basic_playbook
ansible-playbook site.yml
----

If successful, your standard output should look similar to the figure below.  Note that most of the tasks return *"ok"* because we've previously configured the servers and services are already running.

== Section 4: Review

You should now have a completed playbook, *site.yml* with a single role called *iis_simple*.  The advantage of structuring your playbook into roles is that you can now add reusability to your playbooks as well as simplifying changes to variables, tasks, templates, etc.  link:{galaxy_url}[Ansible Galaxy] is a good repository of roles for use or reference.
