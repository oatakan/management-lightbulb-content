Welcome To CloudForms
---------------------

This lab provides a quick tour of the console to help you get familiar
with the user interface along with some key terminology we will use in
subsequent lab content. If you are already familiar with the basics of
CloudForms you can skip this lab — after making sure you can login.

[[key-terms]]
Key Terms
---------

Before sinking our teeth into Cloud Forms it is important to understand
some terminology. CloudForms allows for the management of clouds and
infrastructure.

* *Infrastructure Providers* – A infrastructure provider is a management
platform for managing virtual machines from a single type of hypervisor.
Infrastructure providers supported by CloudForms are Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Management (RHEV-M), VMware vCenter and Microsoft System
Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM).
* *Hosts* – Hypervisors running on physical hardware providing virtual
machines and infrastructure.
* *Clusters* – Provide high availability and load balancing for a group
of hosts. Clusters are groupings of compute hosts that share similar
resources such as network and storage.
* *Virtual Machines* – Operating systems running under a hypervisor.
* *Datastores* – Storage locations that contain virtual images and
disks.
* *Cloud Providers* – A cloud provider is a computing platform that
manages instances and allows building of multi-tenant infrastructure
services independent from underlying hypervisors. Cloud providers
supported by CloudForms are Amazon EC2, OpenStack, Microsoft Azure, and
Google Compute Engine (GCE).
* *Availability Zones* – Logical or physical groupings of cloud
resources.
* *Tenants* – Cloud computing provides a common software platform.
Tenants share the platform but are completely isolated from one another.
They have their own data, network and security.
* *Flavors* – Cloud computing offers infrastructure as a service. A
flavor describes a specific type of instance and what kind of resources
are made available to the instance. All instances are created from a
type of flavor.
* *Security Groups* – Tenant based security that defines Ingres and
Egres access to instances.
* *Instances* – Virtual Machines running under cloud infrastructure.
* *Container* – Your software wrapped in a complete filesystem
containing everything it needs to run.
* *Image* – We are talking about Docker images; read-only and used to
create containers.

Accessing CloudForms
--------------------

CloudForms provides a web console that allow you to perform various
tasks via a web browser. Let’s get started by logging into this and
checking the status of the platform.

[[lets-login]]
Let’s Login
-----------

In this section, you log in to the CloudForms Management Engine web
interface.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Navigate to the URI provided by your instructor and login with the
user/password provided (if there’s an icon on the Desktop, just double
click that).

 _Login Webpage_

Once logged in you should see the *Cloud Intelligence* dashboard. This
customized dashboard shows four (or more) widgets.

 _Cloud Intel Dashboard_

[[explore-cloud-intel-dashboard]]
Explore Cloud Intel Dashboard
-----------------------------

Go ahead and explore the data in each of the widgets:

* Vendor and Guest OS Chart
* Guest OS Information
* Virtual Infrastructure Platforms
* CloudForms Status

Feel free to zoom in, download, open in a new window, minimize, and then
minimize it in the dashboard (you also can remove the data from the
dashboard, but do not do this now).

To return to this screen, select *Cloud Intel* → *Dashboard*.

Lastly, experiment with dragging widgets to tailor the view.
