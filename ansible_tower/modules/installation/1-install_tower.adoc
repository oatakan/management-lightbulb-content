====
Step 1: ssh into your control node
[source,bash]

ssh <username>@<IP of control node>
----
Step 2: Change directories to /tmp
[source,bash]
----
cd /tmp
----
Step 3: Download the latest Ansible Tower package
[source,bash]
----
curl -O https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup-bundle/ansible-tower-setup-bundle-latest.el7.tar.gz
----
Step 4: Untar and unzip the package file
[source,bash]
----
tar xvfz /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-*  (Name of tar file that was downloaded)
----
Step 5: Change directories into the ansible tower package

Step 6: Using an editor of your choice, open the inventory file
